# LongNetTSA-ParisTemperature 
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that processes and analyzes temperature data for Paris, sourced from the paris_temperature.csv dataset. The code performs essential data preprocessing steps, including importing necessary libraries, reading and sorting the dataset by datetime (covering the period from 2014 to 2024), and conducting initial data checks. It leverages popular Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and statsmodels for time series analysis, alongside tools like sklearn for scaling, encoding, and splitting data. A key feature of this notebook is the visualization of actual versus predicted temperature values (in Fahrenheit) using a denormalized dataset, plotted to evaluate the performance of a predictive model (e.g., DilatedAttention). This project serves as a foundation for time series analysis and predictive modeling of temperature trends in Paris.
